# Hi there! I'm Serena Kim 👋

I'm a Computer Science & Linguistics student at UCLA, minoring in Data Science Engineering and Film in the Honors Program. 

Coming to the United States at 14, I grew up watching YouTube videos to practice my English. So, I genuinely believe in the power of technology to bridge communities and make opportunities more accessible - because I simply wouldn't be here without it.
